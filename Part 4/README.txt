CS 334 Project: Tea Shop Web Application
==========================

Project Overview:
This project aims for students to develop a visually pleasant and responsive web
application that allows users to browse and purchase different items from a Tea shop.
• Implement a management section for store owners and employees to manage the available items and orders.
• Transform the web application into a progressive web application (PWA) that can be installed in any device and run offline.
• Use GitHub to manage the project and collaborate with team members.
• Use the Python Flask microframework to build the server-side functionality (i.e., backend) for the application.
• Use a database to store and manage the Tea Shop information.
• Create basic APIs to get information from/to the server.
• Make the application publicly available online through a free hosting platform.
• Learn about different hosting environments for your Web applications.
• Practice frontend and backend Team collaboration
